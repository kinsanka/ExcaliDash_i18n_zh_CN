 * Fire a best-effort scene save that survives page unload.
 *
 * The normal axios save pipeline cannot run reliably from a `pagehide`
 * handler (async interceptors, connection teardown), so we use `fetch` with
 * `keepalive: true`, which the browser guarantees to flush even as the
 * document is being discarded. `navigator.sendBeacon` can't be used here
 * because it cannot set the CSRF header nor issue a PUT.
 *
 * Returns true if the request was dispatched, false if it could not be.
