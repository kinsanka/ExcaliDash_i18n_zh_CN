/**
 * S3-mode file rehydration.
 *
 * In S3 storage mode a drawing's `files[fileId].dataURL` is not an inline
 * base64 `data:` URL but a stored reference — either a same-origin
 * `/api/files/<drawingId>/<fileId>` redirect endpoint or a public S3 URL.
 * Excalidraw can sometimes render a raster `<img>` from such a URL, but SVG
 * image elements fail to render and, more importantly, `exportToSvg` embeds
 * the bare reference as the `<image href>` so dashboard thumbnails lose every
 * image (the preview sanitizer drops non-`data:` hrefs).
 *
 * The fix is to fetch each referenced file and re-inline it as a base64
 * `data:` URL before the files reach Excalidraw — on scene load and on socket
 * file receipt. In non-S3 mode every dataURL is already a `data:` URL, so
 * {@link filesNeedRehydration} short-circuits and nothing is fetched.
